The TODO list
=============

(This is a Markdown file)

Feel free to take anything on the list if you want, but do coordinate
so we don't do multiple work on the same thing. Feel free to add
anything to the list as well.

List of things that need to be done before v1.0:
     - Test functionality on frame-enabled sites.
     - Test functionality on dynamically generated forms.
     - Have someone else review the code.
     - Set up a non-public key for Chrome to allow signing of addon.

Items for later:
      - Prepare addons for submission to official sites.
