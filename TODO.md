The TODO list
=============

(This is a Markdown file)

List of things that needs to be done before v1.0:
     - Enable configuration in Firefox.
     - Enable configuration of modifier rules in Chrome.
     - Test functionality on frame-enabled sites.
     - Have someone else review the code.
     - Set up a non-public key for Chrome to allow signing of addon.
     - Better build system.

Items for later:
      - Prepare addons for submission to official sites.
